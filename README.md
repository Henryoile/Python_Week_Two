# 🐍 Python Week 2 – List Operations Assignment

This project is part of my Python learning journey.  
It demonstrates **basic list operations** in Python using step-by-step tasks.

## 📋 Task Overview
The program performs the following operations:
1. Creates an empty list called `my_list`.
2. Appends the values **10, 20, 30, 40** to the list.
3. Inserts the value **15** at the second position.
4. Extends the list with **[50, 60, 70]**.
5. Removes the last element from the list.
6. Sorts the list in ascending order.
7. Finds and prints the index of the value **30**.

## 🚀 How to Run
```bash
python my_list_script.py
